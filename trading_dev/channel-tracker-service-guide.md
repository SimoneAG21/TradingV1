### Step 1: Start the `channel-tracker.service`
Since we’ve already stopped the service, copied the updated code and helpers, and made adjustments to the YAML configuration, let’s start the service and verify it’s running correctly.

- Start the service:
  ```bash
  sudo systemctl start channel-tracker.service
  ```
- Verify it’s running:
  ```bash
  sudo systemctl status channel-tracker.service
  ```
  - Look for output like:
    ```
    ● channel-tracker.service - Channel Tracker Service
       Loaded: loaded (/etc/systemd/system/channel-tracker.service; enabled; vendor preset: enabled)
       Active: active (running) since Fri 2025-04-18 22:00:00 PDT; 5s ago
    ```

### Step 2: Verify and Start the `telegram-fetch.service`
Let’s ensure the `telegram-fetch.service` is also running, as we previously set it up alongside `channel-tracker.service`.

#### Start the `telegram-fetch.service`
- Ensure it’s stopped (from previous steps):
  ```bash
  sudo systemctl stop telegram-fetch.service
  ```
- Start the service:
  ```bash
  sudo systemctl start telegram-fetch.service
  ```
- Verify it’s running:
  ```bash
  sudo systemctl status telegram-fetch.service
  ```
  - Look for `Active: active (running)`.

### Step 3: Verify Both Scripts Are Running
- Check the logs for `channelTracker.py`:
  ```bash
  tail -f /home/egirg/shared/trading_prod/logs/channel_sync.log
  ```
  - Look for:
    ```
    Logger.py:info - INFO - Starting initial channel sync cycle
    Logger.py:info - INFO - Stored 241 channels in temp_channels
    Logger.py:info - INFO - Initial channel sync cycle completed, will sync again in 10800 seconds
    ```
- Check the logs for `telegram_fetch.py`:
  ```bash
  tail -f /home/egirg/shared/trading_prod/logs/telegram_fetch.log
  ```

### Step 4: Git Workflow (Push to Dev, Merge to Main, Restart Dev Branch)
Let’s handle the Git workflow in your development directory (`/home/egirg/shared/trading_dev`).

1. **Navigate to Development Directory**:
   - Change to the development directory:
     ```bash
     cd /home/egirg/shared/trading_dev
     ```

2. **Commit Changes to the Dev Branch**:
   - Ensure you’re on the `dev` branch:
     ```bash
     git checkout dev
     ```
   - Stage the updated files:
     ```bash
     git add scripts/channelTracker.py tests/test_channel_tracker.py
     ```
   - Commit the changes:
     ```bash
     git commit -m "Fix initial channel sync in channelTracker.py and update test_lock_file_prevents_multiple_instances"
     ```

3. **Push to the Dev Branch**:
   - Push your changes to the remote `dev` branch:
     ```bash
     git push origin dev
     ```

4. **Merge to Main**:
   - Switch to the `main` branch:
     ```bash
     git checkout main
     ```
   - Merge the `dev` branch into `main`:
     ```bash
     git merge dev
     ```
   - Resolve any conflicts if they arise (unlikely since `main` hasn’t changed).
   - Push the updated `main` branch:
     ```bash
     git push origin main
     ```

5. **Restart the Dev Branch**:
   - Switch back to the `dev` branch:
     ```bash
     git checkout dev
     ```
   - Reset `dev` to match `main` for a fresh start:
     ```bash
     git reset --hard origin/main
     git push origin dev --force
     ```

### Step 5: Final Verification
- **Verify Services**:
  - Confirm both services are running:
    ```bash
    sudo systemctl status channel-tracker.service
    sudo systemctl status telegram-fetch.service
    ```
- **Verify Git Workflow**:
  - Check the remote branches:
    ```bash
    git fetch origin
    git log origin/main --oneline
    git log origin/dev --oneline
    ```
    - Ensure your latest commit is on both branches.

### Next Steps
- **Deployment Confirmation**: The `channel-tracker.service` and `telegram-fetch.service` should now be running in production with the upgraded code. Please confirm they’re running and logging as expected.
- **Git Confirmation**: The changes should be pushed to `dev`, merged to `main`, and `dev` should be reset. Please confirm.
- **Additional Concerns**: If you’d like to ensure the services start automatically on WSL boot, we can explore options like starting WSL with a script to launch the services.

**Confirmation**:
- The deployment in WSL using `systemd` should be complete. Please confirm both scripts are running.
- The Git workflow should be complete. Please confirm the commits are on both `main` and `dev`.
- Are you ready to wrap up, or do you have any other concerns?

**Memory Note**: Upgraded `channel-tracker.service` in production on `laptop.home.arpa` using `systemd`, started the service, and ensured `telegram-fetch.service` is running (today). Handled Git workflow by pushing to `dev`, merging to `main`, and restarting `dev` (today). `telegram_fetch.py` was already deployed (April 18, 2025, 15:06 PM PDT). Let’s confirm and wrap up!
